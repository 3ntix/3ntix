This project was made with the intent to jump-start my career in Web Development by making a simple one-page portfolio, using HTML, CSS, SCSS and a bit of Javascript.

If you are to use this project in anyway, please don't forget that, as this project has SASS installed, it will require you to first run the "npm run scss" script in order to convert the SCSS into CSS.

If you have any feedback you'd like to give, please don't hesitate to hit me up @joaormartinho on LinkedIn.
